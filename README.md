# airbnb-clone-project
**About the Project**
The Airbnb Clone Project is a comprehensive, real-world application designed to simulate the development of a robust booking platform like Airbnb. It involves a deep dive into full-stack development, focusing on backend systems, database design, API development, and application security. This project enables the developers to understand complex architectures, workflows, and collaborative team dynamics while building a scalable web application.

**Team Roles**
- **Backend Developer**: Responsible for implementing API endpoints, database schemas, and business logic.
- **Database Administrator**: Manages database design, indexing, and optimizations.
- **DevOps Engineer**: Handles deployment, monitoring, and scaling of the backend services.
- **QA Engineer**: Ensures the backend functionalities are thoroughly tested and meet quality standards.

**Technology Stack**
- **Django**: A high-level Python web framework used for building the RESTful API.
- **Django REST Framework**: Provides tools for creating and managing RESTful APIs.
- **PostgreSQL**: A powerful relational database used for data storage.
- **GraphQL**: Allows for flexible and efficient querying of data.
- **Celery**: For handling asynchronous tasks such as sending notifications or processing payments.
- **Redis**: Used for caching and session management.
- **Docker**: Containerization tool for consistent development and deployment environments.
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Automated pipelines for testing and deploying code changes.

**Database Design**
**Users**: Fields for this entity are Id, Username, Contact, RoomId, BookingTime
**Properties**: Id, Propertyname, price, status
**Bookings**: Id, UserId, Timestamp
**Reviews**: Id, UserId, ProperrtyId, ReviewCount, Rating
**Payments**: Id, PropertyId, UserId, Timestamp, Timestamp
